# Sprint 1: Project Design and User Implementation

## Tasks that were completed in this sprint:
1. [Create a landing page:](https://github.com/wurew34/Gator-SubleasingSESPR22/issues/17)
- The project was routed correctly to each destination using react-router-dom. The landing page component was designed so that it was appealing to users to view, and that it also discloses the purpose of the web application.
- It includes a navigation bar with a logo that redirects the user back to the home page, and a button to login.

2. [Create the login page](https://github.com/wurew34/Gator-SubleasingSESPR22/issues/1) and [implement back-end connection to retrieve user information:](https://github.com/wurew34/Gator-SubleasingSESPR22/issues/16)
- Once the user clicks on the login button, it will redirect them to the login page we designed utilizing React Material UI.
- It includes textfields for the e-mail and password, with validation. There is also a hyperlink that redirects users to sign up if they don't have an account.

3. [Create the signup page](https://github.com/wurew34/Gator-SubleasingSESPR22/issues/1) and [implement back-end connection to store user information:](https://github.com/wurew34/Gator-SubleasingSESPR22/issues/16)
- The signup page contains textfields for the user's first and last name, email address, and password. 
- The textfields have validation to authenticate valid input from the user.
